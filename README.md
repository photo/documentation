Documentation
=============
This repository contains all the documentation for the various Photo Project repositories. You can contribute to it by forking this repository, writing, and submitting a pull request. More info is in the contribute/documentation.markdown file. You can also file documentation-related issues in our issue tracker.

All the documentation is organized by area within subfolders of the /docs/ folder. A lot of this is (or will be) mirrored on http://www.theopenphotoprojet.org. 

'''Big picture TODO'''
* Contributing to other areas: mobile apps, exporters, ...
* Copyediting the files for grammatical correctness
* Checking the guides for correctness and finishing the Shared Hosting guide
* Documenting other repositories that aren't well-documented such as the mobile apps
* Manual of Style?
