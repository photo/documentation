## Extend Trovebox

You can do more with your Trovebox photo than upload and organize photos. You may already be familiar with storing your photos in your own storage space, importing photos from other sites, and uploading photos with our mobile apps. Here are a few more tools to make your Trovebox site even more useful.

### See How Many People Visit Your Site
If you’ve wondered how many people visit your Trovebox site, you can install Google Analytics and start gathering stats. Get started in a few short steps.

* Log into [Google Analytics](https://google.com/analytics/) and create a new site to track.
* In the admin section, find your tracking ID under the tracking info section. Make a note of this.
* In your Trovebox site settings, click Configure next to Google Analytics and enter your tracking ID.
* You can view your site stats anytime at Google Analytics.

Don’t like Google Analytics? No problem. We also support site stats through the self-hosted Piwik.

### Import Photos From Other Sites
Trovebox currently supports imports from Facebook, Flickr, and Instagram, but what about those other photo sites out there? [Pi.pe](http://pi.pe), a media distribution gateway, has some of those covered.

**If you have a free account, you may go over the 100 photos/month limit with this upload.**

Pi.pe [has an excellent guide](http://blog.pixelpipe.com/2012/12/10/configuring-openphoto-as-a-pi-pe-service/) on getting started that goes into more detail. We’ll let them take it from here.

### Use Your Trovebox Photos on Your Blog
If you use WordPress, you can use your individual Trovebox images on your blog. [Download our plugin](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/openphoto/) to your WordPress site and go to OpenPhoto in settings to configure it. Enter your site URL and which photo size you’d like to use when inserting an image in your post, and enjoy inserting your Trovebox images into posts.

The Trovebox source and API are open source, so if you want to build something, [get started](https://trovebox.com/documentation). Email us at support@trovebox.com if you’d like to see your creation here.
