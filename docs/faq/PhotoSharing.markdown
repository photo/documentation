Photo Sharing
=======================

## How do I share a photo?
You can share a photo by clicking the arrow button at the photo's page or in the gallery. You'll then see the options to share the photo.

## Where can I share a photo to?
Right now we support sharing via email, Facebook, or Twitter.

## Can I share an album instead of a photo?
Yes. Click the Share button that appears when hovering over an album's summary, then share in the same way you'd share a photo.

## How do I share a private photo?
You can share a private photo in the same way that you'd share a public photo. When you share a private photo a sharing token gets added to the photo URL, which a recipient can use to view the photo without logging in.

## Wait, sharing tokens? How do those work?
When you share a photo, a sharing token in the photo's URL enables other users to view your photo. These sharing tokens expire after a time period that you'll soon be able to set yourself. 

## What happens when I share a private album?
The recipient will be able to see the album and the contents of the album, even if those photos are private.

## Can I set a custom expiration date for a sharing token?
Soon you'll be able to.
