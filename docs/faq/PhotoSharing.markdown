Photo Sharing
=======================

## How do I share a photo?
You can share a photo by clicking the arrow button at the photo's page or in the gallery. You'll then see the options to share the photo.

## Where can I share a photo to?
Right now we support sharing via HTML embeds, email, Facebook, or Twitter. We want to add more sites, so let us know where you want to share your photos.

## How do I share a photo's link via HTML?
Yes. When viewing a photo, click the Share arrow and select the 'Embed in Blog' button. A box will appear with the HTML you can use to embed the photo in your blog, forums, or anywhere else. Copy this HTML, then paste it to wherever you'd like.

## Can I share an album instead of a photo?
Yes. Click the Share button that appears when hovering over an album's summary, then share in the same way you'd share a photo.

## How do I share a private photo or album?
You can share a private photo in the same way that you'd share a public photo or album. When you share a private item, a sharing token gets added to the photo URL. The recipient can then use the full URL to view the photo without 
logging in.

## Wait, sharing tokens? How do those work?
When you share a photo, a sharing token in the photo's URL enables other users to view your photo. These sharing tokens expire after a time period that you'll soon be able to set yourself. 

## What happens when I share a private album?
The recipient will be able to see the album and the contents of the album, even if those photos are private.

## Can I set a custom expiration date for a sharing token?
Soon you'll be able to.

## I changed my mind about sharing a photo.  How can I revoke its sharing token?
In the Sharing Tokens section of your settings, find the photo ID of the photo whose token you want to revoke. Click Revoke, and your sharing token will no longer work.

Don't know where the photo ID is? Look at the photo's URL. The URL looks like yourusername.trovebox.com/p/PhotoID, where PhotoID is the photo ID. The Photo ID does not include the sharing token in the URL.
