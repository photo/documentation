## How much does a Pro account cost?
A Pro account costs $29.99 a year.

## How do I upgrade from a free account to a Pro account?
Visit <a href="https://trovebox.com/upgrade">our upgrade page</a>, enter your credit card info, and enjoy your Pro account!

## Do you store users' credit card info?
No. Your credit card info doesn't go through our servers at all, instead traveling securely from your server to our payment processor's.

## How does unlimited space work with my storage service?
We don't limit uploads for Pro users, but you may face limits from your storage provider. If we're your storage provider then everything is unlimited. 

## Do I have to renew manually every year?
Nope. We'll alert you when your Pro account is going to renew.

## What happens if my Pro subscription ends?
Don't panic! Nothing has been deleted. You resume using a free account, though you're now subject to the free account limitations. You can still access all your photos, free or pro.

## How do I add a top level domain?
Adding a top level domain to your Trovebox site is currently all manual on our end, so there are two steps to take. First, email <a href="mailto:support@trovebox.com">support@trovebox.com</a> with the domain or subdomain you'd like to add to your Trovebox site.

After we've replied and confirmed that we've set up your domain, you'll need to create a CNAME record for your domain. This is a type of DNS resource record, so consult your domain registrar's documentation on where to set it. DNS settings are a good place to start. Enter the following where prompted:

* Name: your subdomain
* Type:	CNAME
* Data (or Alias):	yourusername.trovebox.com.

It'll take up to 24 hours for your changes to take effect.

## How do I add Twitter cards for my custom domain?
Twitter cards are added per domain, so you have to <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards">apply for them separately</a> for your own domain.
