Photo Management
=======================

## How do I upload a photo?
Go to your Trovebox site (it'll look like yourusername.trovebox.com) and click Upload. Click Add Photos and add the photos you'd like to upload. You can also add attributes that'll apply to all the photos uploaded in that batch, such as a tag, an album, a privacy setting, or a license.

## How large can my photo be?
We support photo files of up to 30MB.

## What file types are supported?
Currently we support .jpg, .gif, and .png files. We want to support more file types in the future, so let us know what you'd like to see.

## How do I edit multiple photos at once?
Visit your Gallery at your Trovebox site. From there, hover over the photo(s) you want to edit and click the pin that appears. Click Batch Edit and select the detail you want to edit, change the detail, and click Submit.

## Wait, Batch Edit? How does that work?
Batch Edit lets you edit multiple photos at once. Currently you can add or remove tags or albums. You can also edit privacy settings or delete a set of photos.

To use Batch Edit, visit your gallery and hover over the photos you want to edit. Click the pushpins of each photo. You can also select all, which will select all the visible photos. Then select Batch Edit and edit away.

## How do I delete a photo?
Visit your gallery or an album. Hover over the photo you want to delete. You'll see the title of the photo along with a few icons. Click the trash can to delete the photo, then confirm you want to delete the photo.

## How do I change the privacy setting of a photo?
You can do this by visiting the individual photo or by finding that photo in a gallery or album. In gallery or album view, hover over the photo you want to change to private (or public). You'll see the title of the photo along with a few icons, including a lock. In full detail view, you'll see the photo's privacy on the right side with the rest of the photo info. An unlocked lock indicates a public photo, while a locked one means the photo is private. Click the lock to toggle the privacy setting.

## How do I edit the title or description of a photo?
Visit the photo whose info you want to edit, then click the title or description. Enter your new title or description in the box that appears and save. You can also edit the title directly from the gallery or album view.

## How do I download an individual photo?
You can download a photo directly if you or the user has enabled that option in the settings page. To do so, view the full details of the photo you want to download and click the Download link on the right hand side.

## How can I change my user photo?
If you'd like to set one of your uploaded photos as your user photo, visit your gallery, find a photo you'd like to use, and select the person icon.

## What are albums? How do they work?
An album is a collection of photos grouped around a theme of your choice. This lets you share many photos with friends or browse your own photos more easily. Albums can be public or private on your albums page.

## How do I create an album?
While you're logged into your Trovebox site, visit Albums. Select Create Album, enter the name of your album under the Create Album section, and click Create.

## How do I add a photo to an album?
You can add a photo to an album by hovering over the photo in your gallery and pinning it. Then select Batch Edit and Add to Album. Select the album you want to add the photo to and save.

## How do I delete an album?
Hover over the album you want to delete in the albums page and click the trash can. Confirm that you want to delete the album. The photos in that album are still safe.
