Photo Storage
=======================

## Where can I store my photos?
Right now Trovebox supports Amazon S3, Box.com, Dropbox, CX.com, and DreamHost DreamObjects.

## How do I switch where my photos are stored?
Visit <a href="http://trovebox.com/migrate">the storage migration page</a> while logged in, select where you'd like your photos to go, and follow the instructions.

## How can I import my photos?
You can import your photos through the Upload photos page when you're logged into Trovebox. At the bottom of the Upload photos page are links to import photos from Flickr, Facebook, and Instagram. Select the site(s) you'd like to import from and follow the instructions.

## Can I keep uploading to another photo site and have that photo automatically show up in Trovebox?
Not directly through Trovebox, but you can use sites like <a href="http://ifttt.com">ifttt</a> or <a href="http://pi.pe">Pixelpipe</a> that will automatically upload a picture to Trovebox when you upload a picture somewhere else (or vice versa).

## Is there a limit to how many photos I can upload?
If you're a free user you can upload up to 100 photos per month. Pro account holders get unlimited uploads.

## If I'm a free user, do I lose access to my photos after using a certain amount of space or hitting my montly upload limit?
Nope. Your photos are yours, and you still have access to everything you've previously uploaded.
