OpenPhoto / Documentation
=======================

You can find the documentation at http://theopenphotoproject.org/documentation. It's a mirror of what is here but easier to follow.

If you'd like to contribute to the documentation, please do! We welcome any and all contributions. Fork this repository (documentation) and add your contribution, then send a pull request. The docs/contribute/documentation.markdown in this repository explains everything you need to more.

Questions? We're here to help. Email our mailing list at openphoto@googlegroups.com or ask in #openphoto on Freenode.
