Trovebox / Documentation
=======================

Whether you’re looking to install Trovebox yourself or build something with our API, you’re in the right place. 

### What you’ll find here

#### Guides

Our guides walk you through installing Trovebox Community Edition.

#### API

The Trovebox API makes it easy for you to read and write data from your Trovebox site as well as creating Trovebox clients.

#### Libraries

Trovebox’s language libraries make getting started with our API even easier. Download one of our language libraries, get to know it by reading its documentation, and start hacking.

#### Plugins

Trovebox comes with a set of plugins you can enable. The plugins section will eventually provide documentation for these plugins as well as how to write your own. Bug someone to write this.

### Contributing

The main Trovebox code is released under an open source license, so you can fork the code, install it yourself, and modify the code. If you’re interested in contributing your modified code back to our codebase, our contributors section tells you everything you need to know.

### Found a bug?

We track our bugs in Github, and we welcome all bug reports, no matter how small.

### Questions?

If you have any questions, we’re here to help. Email our mailing list at openphoto@googlegroups.com or ask in #openphoto on Freenode.
